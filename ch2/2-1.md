## 2.1 Basic Built-in Types
Basic Built-in Types could be divided to
1. **arithmetic types**
2. **void**

Arithmetic types contain **integral types** and **floating types**.
### 2.1.1 Arithmetic Types
| type | meaning | minimum size |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| bool | boolean type | undefined |
| char | character | 8-bit |
| wchar_t | wide character | 16-bit |
| char16_t | unicode character | 16-bit |
| char32_t | unicode character | 32-bit |
| short | short integer | 16-bit |
| int | integer | 16-bit |
| long | long integer | 32-bit |
| long long | long integer | 64-bit |
| float | single precision | 6 valid digits |
| double | double precision | 10 valid digits |
| long double | extended precision | 10 valid digits |

The smallest addressable memory block is called **Byte**.
The basic unit of storage is called **word**.
**Byte** consists 8 bits. **Word** consists of 4 or 8 bytes.
The type of data stored in a specific address determines the number
of bits and how to explain the content of these bits.

Generally, **Float** consists of 1 word(32 bits), **Double** consists
of 2 words(64 bits), **Long Double** consists of 3 to 4 words(96bits or 128bits).

#### Signed Types and Unsigned Types
Excluding **Boolean Types** and extended character types(wchar_t, char16_t, char32_t), 
other integral types could be divided to **signed** types and **unsigned** types.
Character types are categorized into **char**, **signed char** and **unsigned char**.
